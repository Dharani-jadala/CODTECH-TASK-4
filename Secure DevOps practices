DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality. Secure DevOps is the integration of security practices within the DevOps process. It ensures that security is considered at every stage of the software development life cycle, from design to deployment and maintenance.
Here are some secure DevOps practices:
 * Shift left: Security should be considered from the very beginning of the development process, not as an afterthought. This means that security teams should be involved in the design and planning phases of a project.
 * Automate security testing: Security testing should be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. This will help to identify and fix vulnerabilities early on.
 * Use infrastructure as code (IaC): IaC allows you to manage and provision your infrastructure through code. This can help to improve security by ensuring that your infrastructure is configured correctly.
 * Monitor and log everything: It is important to monitor your systems and applications for security threats. This can be done by collecting logs and analyzing them for suspicious activity.
 * Use a security information and event management (SIEM) system: A SIEM system can help you to collect and analyze security data from a variety of sources. This can help you to identify and respond to security threats more quickly.
 * Train your team: Your team should be trained on secure DevOps practices. This will help them to understand the importance of security and how to implement it in their work.
By following these practices, you can help to ensure that your applications and systems are secure.
