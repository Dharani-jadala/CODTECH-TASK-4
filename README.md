Secure DevOps Practices: An Overview
This repository explores the crucial intersection of DevOps and security, outlining key practices for building and deploying secure software.  In today's fast-paced development cycles, security can't be an afterthought.  Secure DevOps, also known as DevSecOps, integrates security practices seamlessly into every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), from initial design to ongoing maintenance.  This approach ensures that security is a shared responsibility and not a bottleneck.
This overview highlights some of the core principles and practices covered within this repository:
 * Shift Left Security:  Moving security considerations earlier in the SDLC, ideally from the design phase. This proactive approach helps identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they become costly to fix.
 * Automation of Security Testing: Integrating automated security tests, such as static and dynamic analysis, into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. This allows for rapid feedback and early detection of security issues.
 * Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, enabling consistent and secure configurations.  This also facilitates automated security checks for infrastructure deployments.
 * Continuous Security Monitoring: Implementing robust monitoring and logging systems to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.  This includes analyzing logs for suspicious activity and utilizing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.
 * Security Training and Awareness:  Educating development and operations teams on secure coding practices, common vulnerabilities, and the importance of security throughout the SDLC.
 * Vulnerability Management:  Establishing a process for identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities in applications and infrastructure.
This repository provides resources and examples related to these practices, aiming to help you implement a robust Secure DevOps framework.  Whether you're a developer, operations engineer, or security professional, you'll find valuable information on building secure and resilient systems.  We encourage you to explore the included materials and contribute to the ongoing discussion of Secure DevOps.
